Hello and thank you for checking out my WingmanCodingChallenge website.

Instructions for running the app locally: 
You will need:
1. VsCode
2. Node.js installed on your computer

The first thing you should do is download all of the project files onto your pc onto a folder on your desktop.
Then open vscode click file>open folder> find the folder that you put the project files in and then click select folder.
After that you should be in the project in vs code. At the bottom of your screen there will be a bar that you can pull up. That is the terminal. Enter npm run dev and a local version of the project will load right up.
